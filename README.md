## How to run the project

- Using Github clone de repository https://github.com/takami-rodriguez/AuthTestingApp.git
- Run " npm install && composer install " commands
- Create the .env file in root folder with default options (set your mysql database credentials to connect laravel)
- Run migrations and seeders (php artisan migrate --seed) (You need to create a database first in your .env and set it locally)
- Run the project with php artisan serve
 
#Notes: If you are not running over https, you need to disable the https: true and set to "false".
#Notes 2: I've sent a .env example via email
